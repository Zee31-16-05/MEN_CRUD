# MEN_CRUD
SO this is the crud application i made which consists of mongo express and node js and in that application you will see how the code structure in real world project works
the proper use of core javascript concepts such as async await, callbacks etc has been done and the flow of code right from server.js to route to controller and to model is made.

#requirements
